				<p>Depending on your system security you may be warned by Windows SmartScreen, or other such similar security system, that OverTrack setup has been prevented from running - in the case of Windows SmartScreen, click on More info, then, Run anyway to proceed. This only needs to be done once..</p>

					<p>Step through the install process. We reccomend leaving "start on login" enabled so you don't miss any games.</p>
					<p><img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/tracker/setup.png"></p>
					<p>Upon first launch, OverTrack will need to fetch additional requirements.<br/>
						This process can take some time on first run, but OverTrack will reuse most of the downloaded requirements for updates.</p>

					<p>To ensure SR is tracked correctly you must visit the <i>Role Selection Menu</i> BEFORE and AFTER each game</p>
					<p>For best results for tracking scores, let the tracker see all score screens - this means not tabbing out or leaving the game at the round/game end score screens. </p>
					<p>To close the client, right click the tray icon and select <i>Quit</i></p>

		<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			Fullscreen tracking is not available in Windows 7.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to help with bugs and development the client will upload logs, extracted data, and occasionally full screenshots. <br/>
			Care is taken in the application to mask out any non-game windows or content before extrating data or saving screenshots.
